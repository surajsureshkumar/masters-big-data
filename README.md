# masters-big-data
This repository contains the code and resources for my master's-level Big Data assignment. The project explores concepts of distributed data processing, scalability, and data analytics

Overview
The data.py script in Pre-Processing performs preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning and transforming data fields, to prepare the data for further analysis.

##Dataset
All data files required for this assignment are available from the IMDB Non-Commercial Datasets https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/. 

How to Run the Assignment

##Prerequisites
Make sure to have ython: Version 3.8 or higher

##Libraries:
Install the required Python libraries by running:
pip install pandas numpy


##Download the Dataset
Visit the IMDB Non-Commercial Datasets page.
Download all the required data files.
Place the downloaded file in the same directory as your python script.


##Run the Script
Run the data.py script from the terminal using the following command:
python <FILE_NAME>.py

Expected Output
The script in Pre-Processing performs the following tasks:
Reads the title.ratings.tsv.gz file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Cleans and transforms specific fields in the dataset (e.g., removing prefixes from IDs).
Prepares the data for further analysis.
